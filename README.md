# ConsumerLendingData

This Repository contains a single notebook which documents some intial explorations on the Harley-Davidson lease data

*Please Note* Internal Links don't work when published on GitHub, so the Table of Contents is full of 'dead' links

Because there are no real dependancies, downloading and running the notebook should be a smoother experience. I tried to upload the associated data here as well, but GitHub does easily support large file uploads. 

Instead, I have uploaded the large File (356 MB)h ere: https://www.mediafire.com/file/2yvgu9yg461pn6x/ABS.csv/file

The remaining required data (IDS.txt) can be found in the repository
