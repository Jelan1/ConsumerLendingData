# ConsumerLendingData

This Repository contains a single notebook, *Initial_Explorations*, which investigates the Harley-Davidson lease data.

A look-only version of the notebook appears when you navigate to the .ipynb file. 

Because there are no real dependancies, downloading and running the notebook is possible as well. I tried to put all the associated data here as well, but GitHub does easily support large file uploads. 

Instead, I have uploaded the large File (356 MB) here: https://www.mediafire.com/file/2yvgu9yg461pn6x/ABS.csv/file. The remaining required data (namely IDS.txt) can be found in the repository.

*Please Note* Internal Links don't work when published on GitHub, so the Table of Contents is full of 'dead' links. They navigate correctly in the actual/downloaded notebook
