# ConsumerLendingData

This Repository contains a single notebook, Initial_Explorations, which investigates the Harley-Davidson lease data

Because there are no real dependancies, downloading and running the notebook should be a smoother experience. I tried to upload the associated data here as well, but GitHub does easily support large file uploads. 

Instead, I have uploaded the large File (356 MB) here: https://www.mediafire.com/file/2yvgu9yg461pn6x/ABS.csv/file
 
The remaining required data (IDS.txt) can be found in the repository 
 
*Please Note* Internal Links don't work when published on GitHub, so the Table of Contents is full of 'dead' links
